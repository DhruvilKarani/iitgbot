Now i found this thing important to post because while filling your registration form, you will be asked to choose among nss, ncc and nso. THEY WILL BE WITH YOU FOR 2 YEARS. Here is a description about them and a note of caution -
1. NCC -
 I hope most of you know what is ncc from school level. Now if you choose ncc, you will have regular sessions of it two times a week ( note that you already have PE sessions two times a week ). In ti , you would be doing parade and other relevant exercises along with a chance to take part in 26th Jan parade. Also you have to go in sessions with hair trimmed too short otherwise NO ATTENDANCE!!. 

2.NSO-
NSO stand for sports. So if you have die hard interest in any of sports , then you can choose them . You have to fill three sports according to your preferences. Now getting admitted to cricket, football, and badminton is difficult (for boys!!). And getting volleyball, lawn tennis,table tennis,basketball and athletics is easy.  Now how you get your choice. See, there will be selections for each sport. So while going for selections of badminton, tt and lawn tennis, do carry your rackets otherwise you will be rejected. 
  Fill your first choice very carefully as consider this as your last choice because getting 2nd and 3rd choice sport is very difficult because seats get already full after first sort outs.
  After selections, sessions will be held twice a week for 1.5 hrs. So choose it wisely. each sport has very good coaches who will teach you everything!!

3.NSS-
 Now the form taht you will fill will say that nss is social service in which you will help poor and needy children near the campus. But whats truth is that in nss little work is to be done, most easy to get and most relaxing. Its great, its awesome, its fun and if you ASPIRE FOR BRANCH CHANGE, THEN DO FILL NSS as your 1st choice.
