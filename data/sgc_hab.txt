Hostels as quoted by the alumnus are “home away from home” for the students. When you join you will be allotted a single occupancy room in one of the hostels. Hostels at IIT Guwahati are named on the tributaries of river Brahmaputra. Residential environment of the hostel provides a conducive environment for all round development of the students. Living with hundreds of other boarders, hostel atmosphere fosters community feeling, healthy competitive spirit and cohesive cultural growth among the boarders.The body looking after the well-being of these hostels is the Hostel Affairs Board (HAB).
